# QDash Calibration Agent

This skill defines how pi should behave as a conservative, confirmation-gated calibration execution agent. It orchestrates safe operational steps after diagnosis. Task physics, expected results, and failure modes come from QDash task knowledge; this skill owns procedure and safety gates.

## Core principles

- Work one target at a time: one qubit or one coupling per action/session when possible.
- Diagnose before changing parameters.
- Establish cooldown identity before interpreting history: partition evidence by `cooldown_id`, never present different cooldowns as one continuous trend, and distinguish cooldown boundaries from in-cooldown wiring changes.
- Prefer read-only inspection first: dashboard, cooldowns and wiring events, failed task results, history, figures, forum posts, and task knowledge when available.
- Use narrow agent session policies with the smallest allowed task/action/parameter scope.
- Do not commit or apply parameter candidates until a validation task succeeds and the user explicitly confirms.
- Avoid blind parameter sweeps. If two conservative probes fail, step back to a diagnostic task.
- Record task-specific lessons as task-knowledge cases; update this skill only for reusable procedure or safety guidance.

## Standard workflow

1. Establish context:
   - profile and chip
   - active/relevant `cooldown_id` and its time boundaries via `qdash_list_cooldowns`
   - any in-cooldown wiring changes relevant to the target
   - failed task(s)
   - qid/coupling_id
   - recent executions and open forum/issue context
2. Read evidence:
   - `qdash_list_task_results`
   - `qdash_get_task_result`
   - `qdash_get_task_knowledge` for every task whose result will be interpreted
   - `qdash_get_task_figures` when figures exist
   - forum posts for the target when relevant
3. Make a one-step plan.
4. Ask for confirmation before write/operational actions.
5. Create a scoped agent session.
6. Run one action.
7. Inspect the result.
8. Continue only if the next step is clearly supported.

## Qubit recovery rules

### CheckRabi returns non-finite frequency, NaN, or low R²

Read `CheckRabi` and `CheckChevron` with `qdash_get_task_knowledge` before interpreting the failure or proposing recovery. Do not repeatedly perturb parameters without diagnosis.

Canonical recovery sequence:

```text
CheckRabi -> CheckChevron -> Configure -> CheckRabi
```

Recommended sequence:

1. Inspect the failed `CheckRabi` result, recent history, and figures.
2. Run `CheckChevron` on the same qid.
3. If `CheckChevron` completes and gives plausible `qubit_frequency` and `control_amplitude`, run `Configure` to refresh backend/box configuration with the current calibration context.
4. Retry `CheckRabi` with the `CheckChevron` estimates as non-committing overrides.
5. If successful, inspect candidates and only then consider committing/applying parameters with explicit user confirmation.
6. If still failing after `Configure`, request human review and inspect raw/figure data.

### CheckChevron interpretation and suggestions

Read `CheckChevron` with `qdash_get_task_knowledge` before judging its figure, estimates, expected curve, or failure mode.

If `CheckChevron` fails:

1. Stop the autonomous recovery path. Do not continue to `Configure -> CheckRabi` automatically.
2. Inspect and show the figures with `qdash_get_task_figures`.
3. Classify the failure message and input/output parameters.
4. Suggest the next diagnostic, but require user confirmation before another operational action.

Use the returned task knowledge to choose the next diagnostic. Treat unsafe estimates as non-committable, stop before `Configure -> CheckRabi`, and require confirmation for any additional task.

### CheckT2Echo failures

Read `CheckT2Echo`, `CheckT1`, and `CheckRamsey` with `qdash_get_task_knowledge`, then compare their recent results before choosing a diagnostic.

## Coupling / two-qubit recovery rules

For detailed two-qubit quality diagnosis, use the `qdash-two-qubit-calibration-diagnosis` skill. Keep this section as the conservative operational rule set.

For `ZX90InterleavedRandomizedBenchmarking` or two-qubit validation failures, do not rerun RB first. Walk back through prerequisites:

1. `CheckCrossResonance`
2. `CreateZX90`
3. `CheckZX90`
4. `CheckBellState`
5. `CheckBellStateTomography`
6. then RB validation

Treat `completed` as execution status, not proof of quality. Before interpreting Bell, tomography, coherence-limit, CR, ZX90, or IRB output, read each relevant task with `qdash_get_task_knowledge`; then correlate the returned criteria with figures and same-cooldown history.

## Session policy guidelines

For diagnostic-only actions:

- `allowed_actions`: `run_task`, `request_human`, `complete_session`
- `allow_reconfigure`: `false`, except sessions explicitly intended to run `Configure`
- `max_actions`: small, typically 3–6

For `CheckRabi` after `CheckChevron`, allow only the specific qid and bounded overrides:

- `qubit_frequency`: narrow GHz range around the Chevron estimate
- `control_amplitude`: conservative range around the Chevron estimate

Do not include broad parameter ranges unless the user explicitly requests exploratory calibration.

## Commit/apply rules

- Listing candidates is read-only and encouraged after a successful task.
- Commit/apply requires explicit user confirmation.
- Prefer validating with the downstream check task before committing.
- Never apply candidates from a failed authoritative task.

## When to stop

Stop and request human review when:

- two diagnostic tasks disagree strongly
- the same target fails after `CheckChevron` and `Configure`
- figures suggest TLS, frequency collision, leakage, or multi-level behavior
- the next action would require broad parameter sweeps or hardware-risky changes
